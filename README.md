PyventBrite
==========

PyventBrite is a Python library for interfacing with Event Brite's API.

PyventBrite is licensed under the [Apache Licence, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

Features
--------

PyventBrite uses an IDL, similar to pyfacebook, for quick construction of the querying language.

Not all of Event Brite's API is implmented, but it's not a lot of work to finish the job thanks
to the IDL.

Install
-------

python ./setup.py install
